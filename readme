>> Compile notes
   
   By default this program is mean to run on small embedded devices,
   not on a normal computer, therefore cross-compile is usually required. 
   
   If you have already build minifs toolchain for DF3120, then change
   the compiler in makefile to arm-v4t-linux-uclibcgnueabi-g++, then
   you are set.
   
   If you don't have a minifs toolchain, use arm-linux-gnueabi-g++ 
   instead, and compile with -static. You can install arm-linux-gnueabi-g++
   under ubuntu with 'sudo apt-get insatll g++-arm-linux-gnueabi'
   
   For more information on setting up minifs toolchain, please use google.
